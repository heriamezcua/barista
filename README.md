## Introduction

Barista is a web application, specifically an online store focused on the sale of coffee-related products. The application consists of two interfaces:  

- **Customer Interface**: Allows users to navigate through the store, purchase products, and write reviews.  
- **Administration Panel**: Enables administrators to add products, approve reviews, manage orders, and more.  

Additionally, the application integrates **Stripe** as a payment platform in a fully customized manner.

## Goals

I decided to create an e-commerce website for selling coffee products because I believe it is a crucial feature for businesses in today's digitalized world. Additionally, this project requires the integration of various technologies that I have learned over the past two years of higher education.  

Another key reason is the existing demand for this type of website, which presents an opportunity to attract potential clients who need an online store with payment processing capabilities.  

Specifically, **Baristaâ€™s main objective is to maximize product sales**.

## Technologies Used and Reasons

### Development Environment

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/916cad94-2c4d-4cd4-b506-689e8248c4b3" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **PHPStorm**: I chose PHPStorm as my development environment not only because it was the IDE used at work but also to gain experience with a different environment than VS Code and learn new things.

### Frontend

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/html5/html5-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the web pages. I chose HTML5 as recommended by W3C, benefiting from its features like clear semantic structure, multimedia integration, improved forms, and enhanced performance.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/css3/css3-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **CSS3**: Applied for styling various elements of the website. CSS3 allows custom animations and styles, and with **Flexbox**, it provides a layout module that greatly helps in making the website responsive.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/sass/sass-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **Sass**: Utilized as a CSS preprocessor to introduce programming-like features, nest CSS classes, and improve development efficiency.

- **BEM Methodology**: (Block, Element, Modifier)  
  A naming convention and structuring method for CSS to ensure scalable and maintainable styles.  

  - **Block**: Independent and meaningful UI components.  
  - **Element**: Parts of a block that don't have standalone meaning.  
  - **Modifier**: Variations that alter the appearance or behavior of a block or element.  

  **Example using Sass with BEM:**
  ```scss
  .btn {
     background: none;

     &--primary {
         display: inline-block;
         font-weight: 500;
         font-size: var(--default-font-size);
         color: white;
         padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
         background-color: var(--color-primary);

         &:hover,
         &:focus,
         &:active {
             background-color: var(--color-primary-dark);
         }
     }
  }

## Backend

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/php/php-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **PHP**: I chose PHP for this web application because it is the language I have been working with during my internship and in recent months of class.  

  PHP is widely used for web development due to its ease of use, broad community support, and continuous performance improvements with frequent updates.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/laravel/laravel-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **Laravel**: To streamline development, I selected Laravel, as it is the PHP framework I have used most during my internship.  

  Laravel simplifies development with features such as:
  - A straightforward **routing system**.
  - Efficient **database management** with its ORM, **Eloquent**.
  - **Security** mechanisms, including CSRF tokens.
  - An implementation of the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, which I have previously used in other projects.

</p>


<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/mariadb/mariadb-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **MariaDB**: Chosen as the relational database management system due to my familiarity with its syntax, its seamless integration with Laravel, and its open-source nature.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/apache/apache-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **Apache2**: I opted for Apache2 as the web server for deploying my application since it is widely used, open-source, and actively maintained by the Apache Foundation.

## Package Manager

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/npm/npm-original-wordmark.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **NPM**: Used for managing application dependencies and installing software modules like Bootstrap, Sass, and Vite.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/composer/composer-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **Composer**: Chosen as the PHP dependency manager, required for Laravel projects. Additionally, it was necessary for implementing **Stripe** as a payment platform.

## Graphical Database Manager

- **Navicat Premium 16**: Selected as the graphical database manager since it was used during my internship. It offers powerful functionalities that simplify database management.

## Payment Platform

- **Stripe**: Chosen for its **security** (compliant with PCI DSS Level 1), **ease of implementation**, and **scalability**, making it simple to reuse in future projects.

## Incident Tracking and Project Management

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/jira/jira-original.svg" width="75" height="75"></br>
- **Jira**: Used for issue tracking and project management. It was the tool used during my internship, making it useful for learning and maintaining a record of errors.

## Hosting

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/oracle/oracle-original.svg" width="100" height="50"></br>
- **Oracle Bare Metal Server**: Chosen as the hosting provider, specifically their **Madrid data center**. The decision was based on their **free and powerful machine offering**.

## Domain Manager

- **Hostinger**: Selected due to prior experience using it and its **user-friendly interface**.
